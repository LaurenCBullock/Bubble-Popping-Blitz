        <h2>Bubble Popping Blitz</h2>
        <p>
           Bubble popping blitz is a simple puzzle game in which players will have an allotted number of moves to pop all the bubbles on the board. Upon being popped the bubbles will release droplets in all four cardinal directions that will increase the size of the first bubble they hit, if they are at max size then they too will pop. the game is based on chaining the pops together which optimizes bubbles popped per move. There will also be power-ups that make the game more balanced as some bubbles can stand in the way of large chains,  so it is advantageous to obtain them as you go.

            I'm a sophomore majoring in Game Design and Development. I made a game with HTML5 canvas and Javascript over the summer so I'm quite familiar with designing games for the web in Javascript. I'm also a huge fan of 3D modeling and spend a lot of my free time doing that.
