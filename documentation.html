        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>I decided to base this game off an old Disney fairy’s game.  I started off with the base code from circle blast to have the basic game layout. Then I created a basic 2D array to make the grid system. I created the bubbles and droplets/bullets next. The collisions between the two were problematic for a while, the first time it was because of a code error and the second time it was because I was implementing size for the bubbles. In implementing size for bubbles the collision had to be updated so if the size was smaller than 4 it would just increase the size and if it was smaller it would just grow. The rest of the game was easier to complete.</p>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
            The size of the bubbles size is randomly generated so sometime the game may be more difficult than others.

        <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
        <p>
           The game has been tested and is fully functional, it throws no error and it uses PixiJS. The game also uses local storage to store the highscore. The game is easy to use and has an old-school look. The page webpage the game is on has valid HTML and CSS.  The Howler library is used to add sound effects to the game to make it more immersive and enjoyable. The code is clean and has nicely commented chunks.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
           In creating this page, I started with writing all the content I wanted to convey into a word document. Then I decided how I wanted to lay it out on a page. Since the information was simple I figured a single column layout would suffice. After that I chose a color scheme that would fit the website. Next I started coding it.  Finally, I checked it over to make sure everything was connected and validated and uploaded it to Banjo.rit.edu.

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
            The game currently being Iframed, as a placeholder, on the project page is a game me and my boyfriend were commissioned to make over the summer. This is the unfinished version without logos, Main menu and control screen.

        <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            This page in its entirety was created by me, it’s HTML and CSS validate and it contains the required content. In addition to that I’ve chosen a nice color scheme and made sure the site is responsive. All the text should be free of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. The site also has a substantial amount of content towards the development of the Bubble Popping Blitz game.
